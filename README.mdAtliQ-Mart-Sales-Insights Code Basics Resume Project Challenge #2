AtliQ-Mart-Sales-Insights

Code Basics Resume Project Challenge #2

AtliQ Mart Sales Insights is a pivotal project addressing service issues at the core of AtliQ Mart's expansion strategy. Headquartered in Gujarat, India, this FMCG manufacturer aspires to reach new heights by venturing into other metros and Tier 1 cities. The challenge lies in rectifying service lapses identified by key customers who withheld annual contracts due to delivery discrepancies.

Peter Pandey, the newly appointed data analyst, assumes a critical role in resolving this challenge. Armed with Power BI, Excel, and MySQL, Peter is tasked with constructing a dynamic dashboard. The metrics, including 'On-time Delivery (OT)', 'In-full Delivery (IF)', and the combined 'OTIF' percentage, are pivotal in gauging daily service levels against predefined targets for each customer.

With a transcript of the stakeholder meeting in comic form and access to additional resources like business knowledge explanations and metadata, Peter delves into the project. His goal is not only to meet stakeholder requirements but to unearth additional insights vital for service improvement.

The project not only promises to rectify existing issues but sets the stage for a seamless expansion into new territories. AtliQ Mart Sales Insights embodies a collaborative effort to harness data-driven solutions for enhancing customer service and driving strategic growth.
